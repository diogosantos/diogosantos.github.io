A friend of mine just asked me that question. “Dude, it’s so year 2000!”, he told me. Indeed, I had to agree with him on that one. It’s totally year 2000 and I used to be a tech blogger back then. But what made me start a blog again in the middle of 2014? Well, maybe it’s midlife crisis, I just turned 30 (haha), or maybe I’m doing some experiments with nice technologies at work and I feel like sharing what I’ve been doing.
