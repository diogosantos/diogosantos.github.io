My name is Diogo Santos. I'm a Brazilian software engineer living in Amsterdam with a passion for technology and arts. I have worked in many projects for many companies, including [Petrobras](http://www.petrobras.com), [TV Globo](http://redeglobo.globo.com), [Americans.com](http://www.americanas.com), [Submarino](http://www.submarino.com.br), [ING](www.ing.nl) and [Gamma](http://www.gamma.nl). More information can be found on [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/diogosantos).

Currently I work for [Info.nl](http://info.nl) on a very challenging project for [BVA Auction](http://www.bva-auctions.com).

Making music and cool new software are my things. I sometimes take a picture or two but I can't call myself a photographer, although I have some pictures I'm really proud of. You can check some of them on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/diogosantos/).
